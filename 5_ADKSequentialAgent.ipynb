    "\n",
    "Now that you have two active agents (Policy Agent and Research Agent), you will orchestrate them. In this lesson, you will use Google ADK's `SequentialAgent` to create a workflow where a user's query is processed by the Research Agent first, and then the Policy Agent, or vice versa, based on the sequential definition. You will use `RemoteA2aAgent` to connect to the servers you started in previous lessons."

       "*   **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text **988** (USA).\n",
       "*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text **HOME** to **741741**.\n",
       "*   **Emergency Services:** Call **911** or go to the nearest emergency room.\n",

       "\n",
       "*   **Through Insurance:**\n",
       "    *   **Call the number on the back of your card:** Ask for a list of in-network mental health providers.\n",
       "    *   **Use their online portal:** Most insurers have a \"Find a Doctor\" tool where you can filter by \"Behavioral Health\" or \"Mental Health.\"\n",
       "    *   **Online Platforms:** Services like **Headway**, **Grow Therapy**, and **Alma** allow you to search for therapists who specifically accept your insurance plan.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Online Directories (Great for filtering by specialty):**\n",
       "    *   **Psychology Today:** One of the most comprehensive directories. You can filter by zip code, insurance, gender, and specific issues (e.g., anxiety, trauma).\n",
       "    *   **GoodTherapy:** Similar to Psychology Today, with a focus on educational resources.\n",
       "    *   **Therapy for Black Girls / Therapy for Latinx:** Specialized directories for finding culturally competent care.\n",
       "    *   **Open Path Collective:** Connects you with therapists offering sessions at a reduced rate (typically $40-$70) if you don't have insurance.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Referrals:**\n",
       "    *   Ask your primary care doctor (PCP) for a referral.\n",

       "| **Psychologist** | PhD or PsyD | **Testing & Therapy.** They have a doctorate and often specialize in psychological testing (e.g., for ADHD/Autism) and deep talk therapy. |\n",
       "| **Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW)** | Master's (MSW) | **Practical support & Therapy.** Trained in talk therapy and often help with connecting you to community resources. |\n",

       "*   **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy):** Helpful for intense emotions, self-harm, or borderline personality disorder; teaches coping skills.\n",
       "*   **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** Specifically designed to treat trauma and PTSD.\n",
       "*   **Family/Couples Therapy:** Focuses on relationship dynamics and communication.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **5. If You Don’t Have Insurance or Have a Low Budget**\n",
       "*   **Sliding Scale:** Many private therapists offer a \"sliding scale\" fee, meaning they adjust the price based on your income. Ask about this before your first appointment.\n",
       "*   **University Clinics:** If you live near a university with a psychology or social work program, they often have clinics where graduate students provide therapy at a very low cost under supervision.\n",
       "*   **Community Health Centers:** Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) often provide mental health services on a \"pay what you can\" basis.\n",
       "*   **Employee Assistance Program (EAP):** Check if your employer offers an EAP. These programs often provide a few free counseling sessions to employees and their families.\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Next Steps**\n",
       "1.  **Make a list** of 3-5 potential therapists.\n",
       "2.  **Contact them** (email is often easier) and ask: *\"Are you accepting new clients?\"* and *\"Do you accept my insurance?\"*\n",
       "3.  **Schedule a consultation.** Many offer a free 15-minute phone call to see if you \"click.\" Trust your gut—feeling comfortable with your therapist is the most important factor for success."
